# 2D Collision Detection

This project contains a few collision detection and resolution algorithms in 2D. The program is 
capable of visualizing rectangle and circle shapes inside a small grid. They are able to move
freely in the space and react to collisions among each other, but also with the map. Most of the
collision resolution physics was taken from standard resources. The detection I tried to think 
through myself.

## Learning Goals

* Look at the physics behind collision resolution
* Understand how to detect collision
* Use SDL3 to visualize this process

## Challenges

The main challenges I had to face where the detections of the collisions. My main goal
was to think this part through myself.
